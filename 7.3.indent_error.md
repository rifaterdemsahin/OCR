rifaterdemsahin: fix

GitHub.copilot-chat.github.copilot.editor: The problem is that the code is written in Python but saved in a Perl file. To fix this, you need to save the code in a Python file.





```python

from PIL import Image

import pytesseract



# Path to the image file

image_path = '/workspaces/notepad/4_imaginary_Source_image_test.png'



# Open the image file

img = Image.open(image_path)



# Use pytesseract to do OCR on the image

text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)



# Print the extracted text

print(text)

```
