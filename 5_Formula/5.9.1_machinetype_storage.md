Yes, the storage capacity increases with the machine type in GitHub Codespaces. Here's a breakdown of the storage for each machine type:

- **2-core**: 8GB RAM • 32GB storage
- **4-core**: 16GB RAM • 32GB storage
- **8-core**: 32GB RAM • 64GB storage
- **16-core**: 64GB RAM • 128GB storage[1](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/changing-the-machine-type-for-your-codespace)[2](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/145944)

If you need more storage, you can change the machine type to a higher specification through the Codespaces settings.

Is there a specific project you're working on that requires more storage?
