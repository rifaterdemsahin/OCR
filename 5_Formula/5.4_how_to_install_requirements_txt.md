# How to Install `requirements.txt` in Python

To install the dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Python and pip installed**:
    - You can check if Python is installed by running:
      ```sh
      python --version
      ```
    - Check if pip is installed by running:
      ```sh
      pip --version
      ```

2. **Navigate to the directory containing `requirements.txt`**:
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the packages listed with their specified versions.
