Setting up a virtual environment can help isolate your project dependencies and avoid conflicts. Here's how you can set up and run your OCR script in a virtual environment:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, create a virtual environment using `venv`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   With the virtual environment activated, install `Pillow`, `easyocr`, `torch`, and `torchvision`:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow easyocr torch torchvision
   ```

4. **Run your script**:
   Now you can run your OCR script within the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python /workspaces/notepad/6_Symbols/2_GetText/ocr_easy.py ./image.png
   ```

Hereâ€™s the complete process in one go:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install the required packages
pip install Pillow easyocr torch torchvision

# Run your script
python /workspaces/notepad/6_Symbols/2_GetText/ocr_easy.py ./image.png
```

This should help you run your OCR script in an isolated environment, avoiding any conflicts with other installed packages. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!
