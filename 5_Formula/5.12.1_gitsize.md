To check the size of a GitHub repository, you have a few options:

1. **GitHub Website**:
   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Insights" tab.
   - Select "Repository Size" from the sidebar.

2. **GitHub API**:
   - You can use the GitHub API to get repository details, including its size. For example, you can use the following URL format:
     ```
     https://api.github.com/repos/username/repository-name
     ```
   - Replace `username` and `repository-name` with the appropriate values. The response will include a `size` field representing the repository size in kilobytes.

3. **Command Line**:
   - If you have cloned the repository, you can use the following command to get the size:
     ```bash
     git count-objects -vH
     ```
   - This command will provide detailed information about the repository size and the number of objects.

4. **Online Tools**:
   - There are online tools available that can check the size of a GitHub repository without cloning it. For example, you can use the [GitHub Repository Size Checker](https://onlineminitools.com/github-repo-size-checker)[1](https://onlineminitools.com/github-repo-size-checker).

These methods should help you easily determine the size of any GitHub repository. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

It looks like your repository has some garbage objects that might need cleaning up before committing. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Clean Up Garbage**:
   - Run the following command to clean up the garbage objects:
     ```bash
     git gc --prune=now
     ```
(myenv) @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/notepad (main) $ git gc --prune=now
Enumerating objects: 28448, done.
Counting objects: 100% (28448/28448), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (20548/20548), done.
Writing objects: 100% (28448/28448), done.
Total 28448 (delta 8404), reused 27715 (delta 7679), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
(myenv) @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/notepad (main) $ 



2. **Verify Repository Size**:
   - After cleaning up, you can recheck the repository size using:
     ```bash
     git count-objects -vH
     ```

(myenv) @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/notepad (main) $ git count-objects -vH
count: 0
size: 0 bytes
in-pack: 28448
packs: 1
size-pack: 2.91 GiB
prune-packable: 0
garbage: 0
size-garbage: 0 bytes
3. **Commit and Push**:
   - Once the repository is cleaned up, you can commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Cleaned up garbage objects"
     git push origin main
     ```

These steps should help you prepare your repository for committing to GitHub Codespaces. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
