Pulling a public Git repository is quite straightforward and doesn't require any special settings. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. **Install Git**: Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from git-scm.com.

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open your terminal (on macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (on Windows).

3. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

4. **Clone the Repository**: Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. For example:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

That's it! The repository will be cloned into a new directory within your current directory.

If you have any specific questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!

There are a few common reasons why you might encounter a "denied" error when trying to pull a public Git repository:

1. **Incorrect Repository URL**: If the URL you provided is incorrect or misspelled, Git won't be able to find the repository.

2. **Network Issues**: Problems with your internet connection or firewall settings might prevent Git from accessing the repository.

3. **Permissions Issues**: Although public repositories are generally accessible to everyone, there might be specific permissions set by the repository owner that restrict access.

4. **Authentication Issues**: If the repository has been made private or requires authentication for some reason, you might need to provide credentials.

5. **Repository Does Not Exist**: The repository might have been deleted or moved to a different location.

6. **Rate Limiting**: If you're making too many requests to GitHub or another Git hosting service in a short period, you might hit rate limits, which can result in access being denied.
