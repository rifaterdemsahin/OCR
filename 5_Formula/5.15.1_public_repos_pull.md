Pulling a public Git repository is quite straightforward and doesn't require any special settings. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. **Install Git**: Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from git-scm.com.

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open your terminal (on macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (on Windows).

3. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

4. **Clone the Repository**: Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. For example:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

That's it! The repository will be cloned into a new directory within your current directory.
