ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'

It looks like the `PIL` module (Python Imaging Library) is missing from your virtual environment. You can install it using `pip`. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if it's not already activated):
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install the `Pillow` package**, which is the modern fork of `PIL`:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

3. **Run your script again**:
   ```bash
   python /workspaces/notepad/6_Symbols/2_GetText/ocr_easy.py ./image.png
   ```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!
