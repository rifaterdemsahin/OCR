The error you're encountering indicates that the Python Imaging Library (PIL) is not found in your environment. PIL has been succeeded by the Pillow library, which you've already installed. However, the issue persists, suggesting a possible misconfiguration in your environment.

Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Ensure that Pillow is installed in the correct environment. Activate your virtual environment (`myenv`) and run:
     ```bash
     pip show Pillow
     ```
     This command will display information about the Pillow installation, including its location. If it doesn't return any details, Pillow might not be installed in the active environment.
     
     (myenv) PS C:\projects\OCR> pip show Pillow

2. **Check Python Interpreter:**
   - Confirm that you're using the correct Python interpreter. In your virtual environment, run:
     ```bash
     which python
     ```
     This will show the path to the Python interpreter being used. Ensure that this matches the interpreter for which Pillow was installed.

3. **Uninstall Conflicting Packages:**
   - If there's any ambiguity between PIL and Pillow, uninstall both to prevent conflicts:
     ```bash
     pip uninstall PIL Pillow
     ```

4. **Reinstall Pillow:**
   - After uninstallation, reinstall Pillow:
     ```bash
     pip install Pillow
     ```

5. **Check for Naming Conflicts:**
   - Ensure that there's no file named `PIL.py` in your project directory, as it can shadow the actual Pillow module.

6. **Update pip:**
   - As noted, there's a newer version of pip available. Updating pip can sometimes resolve installation issues:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

7. **Verify Import Statement:**
   - Ensure that your import statement in `ocr_easy.py` is correct:
     ```python
     from PIL import Image
     ```
     This is the correct way to import the Image module from Pillow.

8. **Restart Your IDE or Terminal:**
   - Sometimes, the environment needs to be refreshed. Close and reopen your IDE or terminal to ensure that changes take effect.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` error. If the issue persists, consider creating a new virtual environment and reinstalling the necessary packages to ensure a clean setup.

The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` persists despite Pillow being installed in your virtual environment. Let's further investigate and resolve this issue.

**1. Verify the Python Interpreter in Use:**

In PowerShell, the `which` command isn't recognized. Instead, you can use the `Get-Command` cmdlet to determine the path of the Python interpreter you're using:

```powershell
Get-Command python
```

This command will display the path to the `python` executable. Ensure that this path points to the Python interpreter within your virtual environment (`myenv`). If it doesn't, you might be using the system-wide Python interpreter instead of the one in your virtual environment.

**2. Confirm the Virtual Environment Activation:**

Ensure that your virtual environment (`myenv`) is activated. In PowerShell, you can activate it using:

```powershell
.\myenv\Scripts\Activate
```

After activation, the prompt should reflect the active environment, typically prefixed with `(myenv)`.

**3. Check for Naming Conflicts:**

Ensure there's no file named `PIL.py` or a directory named `PIL` in your project directory (`C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\`). Such files can shadow the actual Pillow module, leading to the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**4. Test the Import in an Interactive Session:**

After activating your virtual environment, open an interactive Python session and try importing the `Image` module:

```python
python
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> print(Image.__file__)
```

If the import is successful, this command will display the path to the `Image` module, confirming that Pillow is correctly installed and accessible.

**5. Update pip:**

As previously noted, there's a newer version of `pip` available. Updating `pip` can sometimes resolve installation issues:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**6. Reinstall Pillow:**

If the issue persists, consider uninstalling and reinstalling Pillow:

```powershell
pip uninstall Pillow
pip install Pillow
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` error. If the problem continues, consider creating a new virtual environment and reinstalling the necessary packages to ensure a clean setup.

The `Get-Command python` output indicates that your system is using `python.exe` located at `C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\myenv\Scripts\python.exe`. This suggests that your virtual environment (`myenv`) is correctly set up and activated. However, the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` persists despite Pillow being installed.

**Next Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Check for Naming Conflicts:**
   - Ensure there's no file or directory named `PIL` or `PIL.py` in your project directory (`C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\`). Such naming conflicts can shadow the actual Pillow module.

2. **Verify the Import Statement:**
   - In your `ocr_easy.py` script, confirm that the import statement is correctly written as:
     ```python
     from PIL import Image
     ```
   - Ensure there are no typos or incorrect capitalizations.

3. **Test the Import in an Interactive Session:**
   - Activate your virtual environment and start an interactive Python session:
     ```powershell
     .\myenv\Scripts\Activate
     python
     ```
   - Within the session, try importing the `Image` module:
     ```python
     from PIL import Image
     ```
   - If the import is successful, this indicates that Pillow is installed correctly. If not, it will provide an error message that can offer more insight.

4. **Check Python Path:**
   - In the interactive Python session, check the system path to ensure it includes the directory where Pillow is installed:
     ```python
     import sys
     print(sys.path)
     ```
   - The output should include a path similar to `C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\myenv\Lib\site-packages`. If this path is missing, Python might not be looking in the correct directory for installed packages.

5. **Reinstall Pillow:**
   - Sometimes, reinstalling can resolve underlying issues:
     ```powershell
     pip uninstall Pillow
     pip install Pillow
     ```
   - After reinstalling, repeat the import test in an interactive session to confirm the issue is resolved.

6. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**
   - If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure that the virtual environment is using the correct interpreter. You can specify the Python interpreter when creating the virtual environment:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Replace `python` with the full path to the desired Python executable if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` error. If the issue persists, consider creating a new virtual environment and reinstalling the necessary packages to ensure a clean setup. 

---The successful import of `Image` from the `PIL` module in the interactive Python session indicates that Pillow is correctly installed and accessible within your virtual environment. However, encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` when running your script suggests that the script might be executed outside of this environment.

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Ensure Virtual Environment Activation:**
   - Before running your script, confirm that the virtual environment (`myenv`) is activated. In PowerShell, you can activate it using:
     ```powershell
     .\myenv\Scripts\Activate
     ```
   - After activation, your prompt should display `(myenv)` indicating that the environment is active.

2. **Run the Script Using the Virtual Environment's Python Interpreter:**
   - Instead of using `python3`, specify the full path to the Python interpreter within your virtual environment:
     ```powershell
     C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\myenv\Scripts\python.exe C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\ocr_easy.py C:\projects\OCR\6_Symbols\4_GetTextLocal\image.png
     ```
   - This ensures that the script runs using the Python interpreter from your virtual environment, which has Pillow installed.

3. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**
   - It's possible that multiple versions of Python are installed on your system, and `python3` might refer to a different interpreter that doesn't have Pillow installed. To verify, run:
     ```powershell
     Get-Command python3
     ```
   - This will display the path of the `python3` executable. Ensure it points to the interpreter within your virtual environment.

4. **Use the Correct Python Interpreter in Your IDE:**
   - If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode, ensure that it's configured to use the Python interpreter from your virtual environment. This configuration ensures that the IDE runs your scripts within the correct environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` error when running your script. If the issue persists, consider creating a new virtual environment, reinstalling the necessary packages, and ensuring that all paths and configurations point to this new environment.
