----------- CAPTURED TEXT ---------- 

  Washington (CNN) — The US-Mexico border is effectively closed off to migrants seeking
  asylum in the United States within hours of President Donald Trump taking office, an
  extraordinary departure from previous protocols that has left many concerned migrants in
  limbo.
  
  It’s a rare combination of two policies — one from former President Joe Biden and other
  from Trump — that have nearly sealed off the US southern border to asylum seekers. With
  refugee admissions also set to be suspended, there are few, if any, avenues available to
  people seeking refuge in the United States.
