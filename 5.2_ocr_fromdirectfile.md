To read text from an image in a Codespaces environment, you can use the Tesseract OCR library. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Tesseract and pytesseract**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
   pip install pytesseract
   ```

2. **Install Pillow** (Python Imaging Library):
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

3. **Create a Python script** to read text from an image:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image
   import pytesseract

   # Path to the image file
   image_path = 'path/to/your/image.png'

   # Open the image file
   img = Image.open(image_path)

   # Use pytesseract to do OCR on the image
   text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

   # Print the extracted text
   print(text)
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

Replace `'path/to/your/image.png'` with the actual path to your image file.

This will extract and print the text from the image.
